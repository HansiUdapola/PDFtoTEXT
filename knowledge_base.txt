your application, or
the date your child gets their visa, if they are already in New Zealand.
They must leave New Zealand before their visa expires.

current temporary visa is going to expire while they are waiting for our decision, we
will normally give them an Interim Visa to let them stay in New Zealand lawfully.

Warning
If their visa does not have a multiple-entry travel condition and they leave New
Zealand, their visa will expire.
Every time your child travels here, they may be asked for evidence that they will be leaving New
Zealand at the end of their stay — unless their visa states 'Return/onward travel not required' or
'The holder of this visa is sponsored'.
Evidence can include:
a ticket for your child to leave New Zealand at the end of their stay
proof you have enough money to buy one, or
agreement that a sponsor or guarantor will pay for one.

course, apply for a different student visa.
Study visas (https://www.immigration.govt.nz/study/study-visas/)
You must provide evidence you have been offered a place, or confirmation of enrolment if you
are a returning student.
The offer of place evidence must include:
the name of your course
how long it will last
whether your study will be full-time or part-time
if you will be learning from a distance or a correspondence student — if studying outside New
Zealand, proof you need to be in New Zealand for more than 3 months to study at your
education provider
the dates of all of the course’s scheduled holidays, if it lasts for more than 1 academic year
(you can provide information about the dates of holidays in a separate document).

12/5/25, 2:52 PM English Language Student Visa » Immigration New Zealand
Note
If you are applying from outside of New Zealand, you can apply with a conditional
offer of place from your education provider. We can assess your application and
approve your visa in principle, but you will need to provide an unconditional offer
of place before we can approve your visa.
An offer of place must also include a declaration, signed by your education provider, to say they
have assessed and are satisfied that the course they offer you is appropriate to your
expectations.
Your education provider must be a signatory to the Education (Pastoral Care of Tertiary and
International Learners) Code of Practice 2021.
Find out if an education provider is a signatory, and how the code protects international
students.

international-school-learners/)
Tuition fees
Unless you are exempt, you must have enough money to pay your tuition fees.
You must be able to show you have paid the tuition fees for 1 course, or 1 year of study —
whichever is shorter.
Depending on your situation, evidence can include any of the following:
a letter or receipt from your approved education provider showing you have paid your fees
confirmation from your education provider that you do not need to pay tuition fees
documents that show you have applied for a government loan in your home country studying
a bachelor degree programme or higher at a private training establishment, or at a university
or institute of technology or polytechnic — with a letter from your education provider
confirming they expect to receive the fees.
If you apply for your visa outside New Zealand, you can choose not to pay your tuition fees until
we let you know that we have approved your application in principle. Your application will take
longer to process as you will need to provide evidence that you have paid your tuition fees
before we can issue your visa.

12/5/25, 2:52 PM English Language Student Visa » Immigration New Zealand
Plan to fund subsequent years of study
If you plan to study for more than 1 year — on a single course or several courses — it can
strengthen your application if you show us a credible plan for how you will pay for your tuition
fees and living costs for the following years. For example, by showing us evidence of family
income.
You do not need to have the money available for any subsequent years now. However, a plan for
how you will fund your subsequent years of study will help us decide if you:
are a genuine applicant
are likely to meet the conditions of your visa
will leave New Zealand before your visa expires, if you cannot get another visa.
Parent or legal guardian
If the student is aged under 10 years and not going to live in a New Zealand Qualifications
Authority (NZQA)-approved school hostel, they must be accompanied by a parent or legal
guardian and live with that person while studying. Grandparents do not generally meet
requirements for a guardian visa, due to our definition of legal guardian .
The parent or legal guardian must provide evidence they:
have the legal right to care for their dependent child (including education and health), and
care for the dependent child in their home country.
Evidence of the legal right to provide care for the dependent child can include:
the child’s birth certificate or adoption papers, if they are the child’s parent
court documents, if they are a court-appointed guardian
relevant legal documents, for example, if they were named as the child’s guardian in a will.
Evidence a legal guardian cares for this dependent child in their home country can include:
their passport or residence document showing they have been living with them in the child’s
home country
documents showing that they have paid for the child’s education
educational records or documents showing they are responsible for this child’s education.
Note
The parent or legal guardian must apply separately for the type of visa they need.

Permission to work
If you are aged 16 or 17 at a tertiary education provider, or in years 12 or 13 at school, you must
have permission to work, for your student visa to be granted with work rights.
Your visa may be issued with rights allowing you to work up to 25 hours a week and full-time in
the summer holidays, or during scheduled breaks if you are at a tertiary education provider or
private training establishment. For this, you will need to provide a letter agreeing that you can
work, from your:
parent or legal guardian, and
approved education provider.

summer holidays. Students aged 15 or younger cannot work on a student visa.
Working full-time in your scheduled holidays
To be given work rights allowing you to work full-time in scheduled holidays, you must provide
information about your course and holidays.
You will need to show:
your course has a value of 120 credits — this information may be on your fee receipt or

must still provide evidence of your progress.
Health
You must be in good health.
We may ask you to have a chest X-ray, a medical examination or both as proof of your health.
If you are staying less than:
6 months, you do not normally need a chest X-ray
12 months, you do not normally need a medical certificate.
When you apply, you must answer questions about your health. This will help to decide whether
you need to provide evidence of a chest X-ray or medical examination. Even if you do not need
these when you apply, we may ask for them when we process your application.
Check the situations where we may ask you to have a chest X-ray or medical examination.
Note
You must be in good health, even if you have medical or travel insurance.
Full fee-paying students do not usually need to provide a medical certificate.

includes any time you have already spent here.

36 months, or
you are aged under 20 and have held New Zealand student visas (or interim visas
with study conditions) continuously since you turned 17.

When we decide if your intentions for coming to New Zealand are genuine, we will consider all
the information that:
you provide to support your application
we have about your personal circumstances
you have previously provided to us.
If you are planning to study a tertiary course after your English study, you can include evidence
of your current English language level in your visa application. This is not mandatory but will
help us assess your study plans.

showing us evidence of family income.

individual — if an individual, they must be a relative or friend of the student.

be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian and live with that person while studying, if aged under
10 and not living in an approved school hostel.
Place on a course
You must have been offered a place on a course by an approved education provider . You will need to
provide evidence of this, or confirmation of enrolment if you are a returning student.
The offer of place evidence must include:
the name of your course
how long it will last
whether your study will be full-time or part-time
if you will be learning from a distance or a correspondence student — if studying outside New
Zealand, proof you need to be in New Zealand for more than 3 months to study at your education
provider
the dates of all of the course’s scheduled holidays, if it lasts for more than 1 academic year (you can
provide information about the dates of holidays in a separate document).
Check our 'offer of place' templates to make sure your offer has the information we need:
Offering a place to a student
(https://www.immigration.govt.nz/study/for-education-providers/offering-a-place-to-a-
student/)
Note
If you are applying from outside of New Zealand, you can apply with a conditional offer of
place from your education provider. We can assess your application and approve your visa
in principle, but you will need to provide an unconditional offer of place before we can
approve your visa.
An offer of place must also include a declaration signed by your education provider to say they have
assessed, and are satisfied, that:
the course they offer you is appropriate to your expectations, and
you have the English language ability and academic capability to pass the course.
Your education provider must be a signatory to the Education (Pastoral Care of Tertiary and International
Learners) Code of Practice 2021.

Tuition fees
Unless you are exempt, you must have enough money to pay your tuition fees.
You must be able to show you have paid the tuition fees for 1 course, or 1 year of study — whichever is
shorter.
Depending on your situation, evidence can include any of the following:
a letter or receipt from your approved education provider showing you have paid your fees
confirmation from your education provider that you do not need to pay tuition fees
documents that show you have applied for a government loan in your home country studying a
bachelor degree programme or higher at a private training establishment, or at a university or
institute of technology or polytechnic — with a letter from your education provider confirming they
expect to receive the fees.
If you apply for your visa outside New Zealand, you can choose not to pay your tuition fees until we let
you know that we have approved your application in principle. Your application will take longer to
process as you will need to provide evidence that you have paid your tuition fees before we can issue
your visa.
Plan to fund subsequent years of study
If you study for more than 1 year — on a single course or several courses — it can strengthen your
application if you show us a credible plan for how you will pay for your tuition fees and living costs for
the following years. For example, by showing us evidence of family income.
You do not need to have the money available for any subsequent years now. However, a plan for how you
will fund your subsequent years of study will help us decide if you:
are a genuine applicant
are likely to meet the conditions of your visa
will leave New Zealand before your visa expires, if you cannot get another visa.
Parent or legal guardian
If the student is aged under 10 and not going to live in a New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA)-
approved school hostel, they must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian and live with that
person while studying. Grandparents do not generally meet requirements for a guardian visa, due to our
definition of legal guardian .
The parent or legal guardian must provide evidence they:
have the legal right to care for their dependent child (including education and health), and
care for the dependent child in their home country.
Evidence of the legal right to provide care for the dependent child can include:
the child’s birth certificate or adoption papers, if they are the child’s parent
court documents, if they are a court-appointed guardian
relevant legal documents, for example, if they were named as the child’s guardian in a will.
https://www.immigration.govt.nz/visas/fee-paying-student-visa/ 5/23

12/5/25, 2:49 PM Fee Paying Student Visa » Immigration New Zealand
Evidence a legal guardian cares for this dependent child in their home country can include:
their passport or residence document showing they have been living with them in the child’s home
country
documents showing that they have paid for the child’s education
educational records or documents showing they are responsible for this child’s education.
Note
The parent or legal guardian must apply separately for the type of visa they need.
Practical work experience
If you are required to do practical work experience as part of your course, you must provide evidence
that it is a requirement of your studies.
Evidence can include:
a letter from your approved education provider confirming that you must complete work experience
as part of your study
a course outline that shows you must do practical work experience — this information may be in your
offer of place document.
Note
Time you spend doing practical work experience is in addition to the hours you are
allowed to work under the conditions of your visa.
However, if your main activity is work, you must apply for a work visa.
Permission to work
If you are aged 16 or 17 at a tertiary education provider, or in years 12 or 13 at school, you must have
permission to work, for your student visa to be granted with work rights.
Your visa may be issued with rights allowing you to work up to 25 hours a week and full-time in the
summer holidays, or during scheduled breaks if you are at a tertiary education provider or private
training establishment. For this, you will need to provide a letter agreeing that you can work, from your:
parent or legal guardian, and
approved education provider.

before submitting your visa application to us. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) is
a reputable and independent third party that is familiar to us, and who can assist you if you want
to do this. This is a user-pays service offered by IOM who will then provide the verification report
directly to us. This service may lead to a faster visa processing time, however it does not
guarantee that your visa will be approved. We may conduct further verification (either of the same
documents or others) before making a decision on your application. You do not have to use the
IOM Document Verification Service, using this service is optional and completely up to you.
If you do decide to use IOM’s services, include the receipt from them with your application. We
also recommend that you submit your visa application after IOM’s authentication results have
been completed and sent to us. IOM will email you when their authentication is complete, and
they have informed us of the outcome. For further information about doing this you visit the IOM
website.

By air: You can submit it from 24 hours before your journey begins.
By sea: You can submit it from 24 hours before your ship leaves its last overseas port heading to New
Zealand.
If you have an NZeTA, you can specify in your declaration that you are applying for a visa on arrival.
A paper declaration form is available for travellers who cannot complete it online.
